<main>
<h2>Roles of Membranes</h2>
<p>The plasma membrane provides an enclosed space, separating the internal cell environment from the external environment, a process called <strong>compartmentalisation</strong>. Membranes are partially permeable and form physical barriers between the cell and its environment, as well as between organelles and the cytoplasm. They also play a role in cell signalling, facilitating communication between cells.</p>

<h2>Biological Membranes</h2>
<p>Biological membranes are crucial for cellular function, providing compartmentalisation and acting as partially permeable barriers. They allow the diffusion of small, non-polar, lipid-soluble molecules such as CO₂ and O₂ directly through the bilayer. Facilitated diffusion involves channel proteins and is necessary for transporting polar or charged molecules.</p>

<h2>Diffusion</h2>
<p>Diffusion is the net movement of molecules or ions from a region of high concentration to low concentration down a concentration gradient. This movement occurs due to the natural kinetic energy of molecules or ions.</p>

<h2>Facilitated Diffusion</h2>
<p>Some molecules cannot diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer, including large polar molecules such as glucose and amino acids, and ions such as sodium and chloride. They pass only through specific channel or carrier proteins.</p>

<h2>Osmosis</h2>
<p>Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration through a partially permeable membrane. It can also be described as the movement of water from high to low water potential. Water can pass through the phospholipid bilayer due to its small size despite being polar.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isotonic Solutions:</strong> Same solute concentration as the cell; no net water movement.</li>
<li><strong>Hypotonic Solutions:</strong> Lower solute concentration than the cell; water enters the cell, possibly causing cytolysis.</li>
<li><strong>Hypertonic Solutions:</strong> Higher solute concentration than the cell; water leaves the cell, causing plasmolysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cholesterol</h2>
<p>Cholesterol within the plasma membrane maintains fluidity by spreading phospholipid tails at low temperatures and stabilising them at high temperatures. It also reduces membrane permeability to ions and provides mechanical strength.</p>

<h2>Glycolipids and Glycoproteins</h2>
<p>These molecules contain carbohydrate chains on the cell surface, acting as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signalling receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters</li>
<li>Endocytosis receptors for substance uptake</li>
<li>Cell adhesion and stabilisation molecules, forming hydrogen bonds with water</li>
<li>Some act as antigens for cell recognition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transport Proteins</h2>
<p>Transport proteins form hydrophilic channels for ions and polar molecules. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carrier proteins:</strong> Change shape to transport specific molecules across the membrane.</li>
<li><strong>Channel proteins:</strong> Water-filled pores allowing selective ion diffusion; many are gated to open/close as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fluid Mosaic Model</h2>
<p>The Fluid Mosaic Model (1972) describes the dynamic, mosaic-like arrangement of phospholipids, proteins, cholesterol, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and transport proteins. Phospholipids move laterally within their layers, while proteins can be mobile or fixed. The model explains passive and active movement, cell-to-cell interactions, and signalling.</p>

<h2>Phospholipids</h2>
<p>Phospholipids have a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail, forming a barrier to most water-soluble molecules. They prevent leakage of substances like sugars, proteins, and amino acids. They can also act as signalling molecules within the bilayer.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting Permeability</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures increase lipid fluidity and diffusion but may denature proteins, compromising membrane structure.</li>
<li><strong>Organic Solvents:</strong> Dissolve membrane lipids, increasing permeability.</li>
</ul>
