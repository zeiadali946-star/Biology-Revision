<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.1px 0.0px; font: 30.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Roles of Membranes</b><b></b></span></h1>
<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.1px 0.0px; font: 13.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">The plasma membrane provides an enclosed space which separates the internal cell environment from the external environment-this is called compartmentalisation.They are partially permeable and form physical barriers between the cell and its environment and the organelles and the cytoplasm. Substances can move via: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis and active transport. They also play a role in cell signalling as a method of communication between cells.</span></h1>
<p class="p4"><b>Bio Membranes</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Bio membranes play a crucial role in cellular function by providing compartmentalisation and acting as partially permeable barriers that facilitate material exchange. They allow for the diffusion of small, non-polar, lipid-soluble molecules such as CO₂ and O₂ directly through the bilayer, a process that occurs passively. Facilitated diffusion involves channel proteins and is necessary for the transport of poor, charged, and water-soluble molecules.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration through a partially permeable membrane. It can also be described as the movement of water from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. Water potential is a measure of water’s ability to move from one location to another, with pure water in standard conditions having a water potential of 0.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Isotonic Solutions</b>: Have the same concentration of solutes as the cell, resulting in no net movement of water.</li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Hypotonic Solutions</b>: Have a lower concentration of solutes than the cell, causing water to enter the cell, potentially leading to cytolysis.</li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Hypertonic Solutions</b>: Have a higher concentration of solutes than the cell, causing water to leave the cell, leading to plasmolysis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Active transport is the process by which all types of molecules are transported through carrier proteins from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration against the concentration gradient, requiring energy in the form of ATP. Exocytosis involves the transport of large particles in bulk, where particles in vesicles formed from the cell surface membrane are transported into the cell. In contrast, endocytosis involves the transport of particles out of the cell, where vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Cholesterol</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Cholesterol is found within the plasma membrane and the phospholipid bilayer. It plays a vital role in maintaining membrane fluidity by causing the phospholipid tails to spread further apart at low temperatures, preventing them from becoming rigid. At high temperatures, cholesterol causes the tails to pack closely together by binding to the hydrophobic tails, thus stabilising the membrane. Cholesterol also affects the impermeability of the plasma membrane to ions and provides mechanical strength and stability.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Glycolipids and Glycoproteins</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Glycolipids and glycoproteins are molecules with carbohydrate chains that exist on the cell surface. They serve as receptor molecules, binding with certain substances at the cell’s surface. There are three main types of receptors:</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Signalling Receptors</b>: For hormones and neurotransmitters.</li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Endocytosis Receptors</b>: Involved in the uptake of substances into the cell.</li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Cell Adhesion and Stabilisation</b>: The carbohydrate part forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules on the outside of the cell.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Some glycolipids and glycoproteins act as antigens, facilitating cell-to-cell recognition.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Transport Proteins</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Transport proteins create hydrophilic channels to allow ions and polar molecules to travel through the membrane. There are two main types: carrier and channel (pore) proteins. Carrier proteins change shape to transport a substance across a membrane, and each transport protein is specific to a particular ion or molecule. Transport proteins enable the cell to control which substances enter or leave, maintaining homeostasis.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Fluid Mosaic Model</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6">The Fluid Mosaic Model, proposed in 1972, provides a comprehensive explanation of the dynamic interactions between cells and their environments. It highlights key processes such as passive and active movement, cell-to-cell interactions, and cell signalling. The model describes how phospholipids and proteins exhibit mobility through diffusion, with phospholipids primarily moving laterally within their layers. While many proteins are mobile within the bilayer, some remain fixed in position. The model is termed “mosaic” due to the scattered arrangement of proteins, resembling a mosaic when viewed from above. The components of the fluid mosaic model include phospholipids, cholesterol, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and transport proteins.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Phospholipids</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p6">Phospholipids consist of a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head, forming a barrier to most water-soluble molecules. This barrier prevents water-soluble substances such as sugars, proteins, and amino acids from leaking out of the cell. Phospholipids can undergo chemical modifications to function as signalling molecules, moving within the bilayer to activate other molecules like enzymes. Upon hydrolysis, they release small water-soluble molecules that bind to receptors in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Factors Affecting Permeability</b><b></b></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p8">Several factors influence the permeability of cell membranes:</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Temperature</b>: As temperature increases, both proteins and lipids are affected. Lipids become more fluid, reducing the effectiveness of cell surface membranes as barriers to polar molecules. Higher temperatures also accelerate diffusion due to increased kinetic energy. However, changes in fluidity are reversible. At certain temperatures, many proteins denature, compromising the structure of the plasma membrane and allowing substances to pass freely.</li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><b>Organic Solvents</b>: These can enhance cell surface membrane permeability by dissolving the lipids within the membrane.</li>
</ul>
