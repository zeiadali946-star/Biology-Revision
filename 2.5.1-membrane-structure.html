<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.1px 0.0px; font: 30.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Roles of Membranes</b><b></b></span></h1>
<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.1px 0.0px; font: 13.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1">The plasma membrane provides an enclosed space which separates the internal cell environment from the external environment-this is called compartmentalisation.They are partially permeable and form physical barriers between the cell and its environment and the organelles and the cytoplasm. Substances can move via: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis and active transport. They also play a role in cell signalling as a method of communication between cells.</span></h1>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Bio Membranes</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Bio membranes play a crucial role in cellular function by providing compartmentalisation and acting as partially permeable barriers that facilitate material exchange. They allow for the diffusion of small, non-polar, lipid-soluble molecules such as CO₂ and O₂ directly through the bilayer, a process that occurs passively. Facilitated diffusion involves channel proteins and is necessary for the transport of poor, charged, and water-soluble molecules.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Diffusion is the net movement of molecules of ions from a region of high concentration to low concentration down a concentration gradient. The random movement is caused by the natural kinetic energy of the molecules or ions.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Facilitated diffusion takes place for certain substances that cant diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer, these include large polar molecules such as glucose and amino acids and ions such as sodium and chloride. They can only pass through via. Channel proteins or carrier proteins which are highly specific to 1 molecule or ion.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Factors affecting Diffusion</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1"><b>Steepness of concentration gradient: </b>The difference in the concentration of substances on the 2 sides of the surface, a greater difference in concentration means a greater difference in the number if molecules passing in 2 directions, therefore increasing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li8"><b>Temperature: </b>Molecules and ions have more kinetic energy at higher temperatures, leading to more kinetic energy as they move faster, resulting in a higher rate of diffusion.</li>
  <li class="li8"><b>Surface Area:</b> The greater the surface area, the greater the number of molecules or ions that can cross at any one moment and therefore there’s a greater rate of diffusion. The surface area can be increased by folding (such as microvilli or cristae). As the cell gets larger, the surface area to volume ratio decreases, slowing the rate of diffusion as there is a greater diffusion distance pathway.</li>
  <li class="li8"><b>Properties of Molecules or Ions: </b>large molecules diffuse more slowly than smaller ones as they require more energy to move. Uncharged and non-polar molecules diffuse directly across the phospholipid bilayer. Non-polar molecules diffuse more quickly than polar ones as they are soluble in the non-polar phospholipid bilayer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Osmosis</b></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration through a partially permeable membrane. It can also be described as the movement of water from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. Water potential is a measure of water’s ability to move from one location to another, with pure water in standard conditions having a water potential of 0. Water can pass through the phospholipid bilayer due to its small size despite being polar.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Isotonic Solutions</b>: Have the same concentration of solutes as the cell, resulting in no net movement of water.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Hypotonic Solutions</b>: Have a lower concentration of solutes than the cell, causing water to enter the cell, potentially leading to cytolysis.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Hypertonic Solutions</b>: Have a higher concentration of solutes than the cell, causing water to leave the cell, leading to plasmolysis.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Active transport</b></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Active transport is the process by which all types of molecules are transported through<b> carrier proteins</b> from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration against the concentration gradient, requiring energy in the form of ATP to change shape of the carrier proteins. Active transport is important in: reabsorption of useful molecules and ions into the blood after filtration into the kidney tubules and the loading of inorganic ions from the soil into root hair cells.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Exocytosis and endocytosis involves the transport of large particles in bulk (such as proteins or polysaccharides, parts of cells and whole cells such as bacteria), exocytosis is the removal of materials such as hormones where particles in secretory vesicles formed from the Golgi are transported out of the cell as it fuses with the plasma membrane. An example is the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pancreatic cells.In contrast, endocytosis involves the transport of particles into of the cell, where vesicles or small sacs (endocytic vacuoles) fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents. An example of this is phagocytosis and pinocytosis (bulk intake of liquids, if the vesicle formed is too small, the process is called micropinocytosis. Both processes require energy.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Cholesterol</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Cholesterol is found within the plasma membrane and the phospholipid bilayer. It plays a vital role in maintaining membrane fluidity by causing the phospholipid tails to spread further apart at low temperatures, preventing them from becoming rigid. At high temperatures, cholesterol causes the tails to pack closely together by binding to the hydrophobic tails, thus stabilising the membrane. Cholesterol also affects the impermeability of the plasma membrane to ions and provides mechanical strength and stability.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Glycolipids and Glycoproteins</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Glycolipids and glycoproteins are molecules with carbohydrate chains that exist on the cell surface. They serve as receptor molecules, binding with certain substances at the cell’s surface. There are three main types of receptors:</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Signalling Receptors</b>: For hormones and neurotransmitters.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Endocytosis Receptors</b>: Involved in the uptake of substances into the cell.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Cell Adhesion and Stabilisation</b>: The carbohydrate part forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules on the outside of the cell.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Some glycolipids and glycoproteins act as antigens, facilitating cell-to-cell recognition.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Transport Proteins</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Transport proteins create hydrophilic channels to allow ions and polar molecules to travel through the membrane. There are two main types: carrier and channel (pore) proteins. Carrier proteins change shape to transport a substance across a membrane, and each transport protein is specific to a particular ion or molecule.Their binding site is open to one side of the membrane first then opens to the other side when the carrier protein switches shape. Channel proteins are water-filled pores which allow charged substances to diffuse through the cell surface membrane.The diffusion of these ions doesn’t occur freely as channel proteins are gated meaning that the inside surface of the membrane can move to close or open the pore.Transport proteins enable the cell to control which substances enter or leave, maintaining homeostasis.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Carrier and channel proteins-polar molecules(water-soluble) and ions.</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Fluid Mosaic Model</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The Fluid Mosaic Model, proposed in 1972, provides a comprehensive explanation of the dynamic interactions between cells and their environments. It highlights key processes such as passive and active movement, cell-to-cell interactions, and cell signalling. The model describes how phospholipids and proteins exhibit mobility through diffusion, with phospholipids primarily moving laterally within their layers. While many proteins are mobile within the bilayer, some remain fixed in position. The model is termed “mosaic” due to the scattered arrangement of proteins, resembling a mosaic when viewed from above. The components of the fluid mosaic model include phospholipids, cholesterol, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and transport proteins.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Phospholipids</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Phospholipids consist of a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head, forming a barrier to most water-soluble molecules. This barrier prevents water-soluble substances such as sugars, proteins, and amino acids from leaking out of the cell. Phospholipids can undergo chemical modifications to function as signalling molecules, moving within the bilayer to activate other molecules like enzymes. Upon hydrolysis, they release small water-soluble molecules that bind to receptors in the cytoplasm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Factors Affecting Permeability</b><b></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Several factors influence the permeability of cell membranes:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Temperature</b>: As temperature increases, both proteins and lipids are affected. Lipids become more fluid, reducing the effectiveness of cell surface membranes as barriers to polar molecules. Higher temperatures also accelerate diffusion due to increased kinetic energy. However, changes in fluidity are reversible. At certain temperatures, many proteins denature, compromising the structure of the plasma membrane and allowing substances to pass freely.</span></li>
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Organic Solvents</b>: These can enhance cell surface membrane permeability by dissolving the lipids within the membrane.</span></li>
